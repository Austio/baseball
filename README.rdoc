Assumptions
  - A player's statistics are calculated for a team based on who he was playing for at the end of the year.
  If this was not true, we would need to figure out how this is calculated and clean up the player_teams table to account for
  partial years or break it down to a specific date range

  - A player can have both hitting and pitching statistics, we will handle that in the statistic model

  - A team can either be in the NL or AL.  If we wanted to deal with teams that can switch divisions, we would add a new table
  that would deal with them being in one or the other based on year.

* File Importing

  - File importing is handled by the FileImporter class and is stored in the service_objects directory.
  - Player importing inherits from file and imports players, inserting them into the database

  All specs for these are located in spec/service_objects

* Models
  Player
  Team
  PlayerTeam - Join table for player/team combo for a specific year.
